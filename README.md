Teaching High School
================
I taught high school math for the 2016/2017 school year. Here are files that
may be of use if you do something similar.

*Documents* provides rules, policies, syllabi, and schedules.

*Standards* provides the list of which chapters in the textbooks I used matched
which standards I was to follow.

Then, for grading I used weighted categories for the first quarter and after
that switched to points. There are two templates (with example names and
scores, but the assignment names match what I actually used first and fourth
quarters): *GradesQ1_points.ods* and *GradesQ1_weighted.ods*. After each test,
I'd copy the scores into the *TestGradeAnalysis.ods* file to see if I ought to
curve the test.

The students would often ask to see their grades as we did not have an online
system, and I did not want them to see anybody else's grades when I was showing
them. Thus, the *GradeReports*. The script generates a text file for each
student in each class also including a list of missed work (for examples see
*GradeReports/20171201* folders). In addition, it updates the "Report" sheet in
the grading file that lists everybody's grades (for printing and giving to
other teachers or for giving to the students).

For setting up the computer lab, see the *ComputerLab* folder.

For each of the documents, I provided a PDF of it as well for ease of viewing.
Each document is for [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
